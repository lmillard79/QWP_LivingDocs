1.          Structure, intents, and purposes
These Guidelines have been structured to provide users practical advice on how to build an HEC-HMS model. The Guidelines proper are included in the main body, whilst advisory notes, observations and outcomes are included in the appendixes. It is hoped that further development will add to the information presented in the appendixes, but the Guidelines proper will remain largely unchanged.

The intent of these Guidelines is to:

·         provide clients with a resource for commissioning HEC-HMS project work

·         provide users guidance on how to apply HEC-HMS to hydrology in the Australian context

·         provide peer reviewers and assessors with resources to check and review work undertaken by others.

The following are NOT included in the intents and purposes:

·         These Guidelines are not intended to teach its readers hydrology. The Guidelines assume that its readers have a competent understanding of hydrology but need guidance on how to put it into practice through HEC-HMS.

·         These Guidelines are not intended to compare HEC-HMS to other hydrological models and platforms. Although this is an interesting topic, it should be addressed through separate papers and presentations

·         These Guidelines are not intended to cover every scenario that requires advanced knowledge and analysis. Again, this should be addressed through separate papers and presentations

These Guidelines are not intended to replace, supersede, or generally conflict with established Guidelines, User Manuals and Technical Manuals.
